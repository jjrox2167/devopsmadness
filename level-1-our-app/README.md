# 🧩 Level 1 – Our App

Welcome to **Level 1** of DevOps Madness: a simple full-stack authentication app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router), API routes, and Prisma + SQLite.


This level focuses on setting up a complete minimal storefront app — with a frontend, backend, and database — that will serve as the foundation for future DevOps workflows (CI/CD, Docker, cloud deployment, etc.).

## 📚 Project Goals

DevOps engineering sits at the intersection of traditional system administration and modern software development.
To understand what’s expected of a DevOps engineer, we first need to see how software developers encounter and respond to the kinds of challenges that DevOps practices aim to solve.

### Our goal is to:

Build an MVP full-stack application from scratch.
- Deploy to infrastructure
  
- Provide a clean base to mimic the need of for containerization & deployment.

- Prepare a real-world scenario for the need of CI/CD through DevOps pipelines.

- Monitoring and Observability when it comes to the application and system's performance.
